# Clustering On the Iris Dataset

# K-Means Clustering:

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data into groups (clusters) based on similarity.
It aims to partition the data into K clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid).
The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates the centroids until convergence, minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares.

# Elbow Method for Optimal Number of Clusters:

The elbow method is a technique used to determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset for clustering algorithms like K-Means.
It involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) against the number of clusters.
The optimal number of clusters is typically identified at the point where adding more clusters does not significantly reduce inertia, resembling an 'elbow' in the plot.

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Dimensionality Reduction:

PCA is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets.
It transforms the original features into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible.
PCA is beneficial for preprocessing data before clustering, as it reduces noise and computational complexity.
